# Web Apps with Python

This web app will build on principles outlined in the [Client-Server Architecture repo](https://github.com/aarondaniels/Client_Server_Architecture). Several additional concepts will be illustrated through a couple of web app projects:

## Project 1 - Book Library Server
Documented in [this folder](https://github.com/aarondaniels/Books_Web_App/tree/main/Books_Web_App)
- Continue work with Flask webserver
- Review JSON web token (JWT) authentication and authorization
- Use and create a book publishing application using web tokens
- Secure API's withi JSON web tokens
- Use JWT built-in and custom decorators

### Functionality of Books Web Application
1.  Matching up the images of the books. When 'Books' page is selected, the book images are displayed next to the book details
2. Add new users and assign roles to new users (i.e. Admin, Reader). Each of the roles will have distinct privledges, as controled via JSON Web Token. 
3. Add route within app that enables adding book's to the library


## Project 2 - School Grading system
- Use Python to develop a school grading system
- Develop data structures based on dictionaries, lists (and a combination of both), as well as list and dictionary comprehensions
